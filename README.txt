Most of this Project is accomplished with two Functions: Infer and Unify. To Build and Run this Code, use the command "make Test". While the Infer and Unify Functions are written in Final.ml, Test.ml will run the twenty-two Test Cases for the Functions. To Build a PDF of the Final Writeup, use the command "make writeup.pdf".
